Welcome page should have links to open the wiki, email me, create a github issue, etc.
Put the pages in a sensible order
Make disks work properly
more software. Probably have a vertical notebook with categories
echo info about the command it's about to run
For some reason the top label on the disks page is slightly lower than all the others.. no idea why
Make the top labels bigger
