The idea of this is that every screen will have multiple options which will change variables for that screen. When you hit the next button it puts those variables together into a command which it appends to a file "install" which is just a bash script that will run at the end.

Ex:

On the partitioning screen you chose to partition /dev/sda1 as ext4. It will set a varible for the partition type and then when you hit next it will add the command "mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1" to the install script. Everything is done in python/pygtk so it can be material with Liri's gtk theme/flat-plat
