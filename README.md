A graphical arch linux installer in python/pygtk

Currently it can generate a script (out.sh) that  will ocasionally work without any modification. Right now you should carefully review out.sh and make sure everything's correct.

You should install [Liri's material gtk theme](https://www.github.com/lirios/material-gtk-theme) to make it look nice
