A graphical arch linux installer in python/pygtk

Installing arch linux is pretty simple. But it's not pretty. This tool will hopefully make it prettier than existing solutions (calamares, arch-anywhere, cnchi, etc.) While also adding some helpful features like page to download common software.

Currently it can generate a script (out.sh) that  will ocasionally work without any modification. Right now you should carefully review out.sh and make sure everything's correct.

You should install [Liri's material gtk theme](https://www.github.com/lirios/material-gtk-theme) to make it look nice

I spent a long time tryint to come up with a name and after having no luck with Alice in wonderland names (family tradition of using AIW charachters as hostnames) I Googled "Animals that start with A" (for Arch Linux) and Akita sounded cool.
