Installing arch linux is pretty simple. But it's not pretty. This tool will hopefully make it prettier than existing solutions (calamares, arch-anywhere, cnchi, etc.) While also adding some helpful features like page to download common software. (It's also much lighter)

Currently it can generate a script (out.sh) that  will ocasionally work without any modification. Right now you should carefully review out.sh and make sure everything's correct.


Install [Liri's material gtk theme](https://www.github.com/lirios/material-gtk-theme) to make it look nice


Here's a screenshot of the first screen, Everything's changing on a daily basis so this probably isn't current:
